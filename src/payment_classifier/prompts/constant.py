payment_intent_prompt = '''
You are an expert dataset generator for **payment intent classification** in P2P chat applications.
Your task is to generate **exactly {count} diverse text examples** that must be labeled as **"payment intent"**.
---

### LABEL TARGET
Produce only examples that clearly represent **payment intent texts**.
A "payment intent" means the text explicitly shows commitment to transfer money, request payment, confirm payment, handle invoices, or fix payment issues.

### DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS
The dataset must follow this approximate distribution across categories of payment intent:
- **Payment request (asking for money)** ‚Üí 30%
- **Pay (confirming / promising payment)** ‚Üí 25%
- **Invoice (sending / referencing invoices or receipts)** ‚Üí 15%
- **Issue (failed transactions, disputes, retries)** ‚Üí 15%
- **Payment Meta / Setup (autopay setup, linking card, confirming platform action)** ‚Üí 10%
- **Other intent-related but less frequent types** ‚Üí 5%

### üé® TONE & ATTRIBUTE SPECIFICATION
- Do **not** use a single fixed tone or attribute.
- Instead, cover a **broad spectrum of tones** (e.g., formal, casual, commercial, urgent, polite, direct, friendly, professional, frustrated, apologetic, excited, seller, bill, error, request, inquiry, setup, card-related, marketplace, social, business).
- Ensure tones vary significantly and **avoid repeating patterns**.
- Use diverse paraphrasing and sentence structures to enhance variety.
- Avoid overusing payment related words like "pay", "send", "money", "invoice", "bill", "transfer", "request", "payment".
- Avoid overusing dollar signs ($) and amounts.

#### Incorporate a wide set of contextual attributes:
1. **Relationship dynamics**: friends, family, business partners, strangers, customers, vendors
2. **Urgency levels**: immediate, deadline-based, flexible, routine
3. **Context specificity**: amounts, purposes, platforms, timeframes
4. **Emotional undertones**: frustrated, excited, apologetic, confident, confused
5. **Platform references**: Venmo, PayPal, Zelle, CashApp, Momo, bank transfer, credit card
6. **Situational contexts**: splitting bills, paying back loans, business transactions, shopping, subscriptions
7. **chat types**:
  - Ecommerce chat: buyer‚Äìseller
  - Shopping chat: marketplace & retail
  - E-wallet chat: digital payment platforms
  - Social commerce: friends/family money requests
  - Business chat: B2B payments
  - Payment Platform auto messages, emails: bank/payment app notifications
  - ...and more

> Complementary and diverse attributes are **encouraged** to maximize dataset realism.

---

### ‚úÖ CLASSIFICATION RULES
A text qualifies as **payment intent** if it includes:
- **Request**: Asking for payment with clear context (‚ÄúSend me $20 for dinner‚Äù)
- **Pay**: Confirming money sent/received (‚ÄúJust transferred the rent‚Äù)
- **Invoice**: Sharing or referencing a bill/invoice (‚ÄúInvoice attached for last month‚Äôs services‚Äù)
- **Issue**: Addressing payment problems/disputes (‚ÄúPayment failed, retrying now‚Äù)
- **Payment Meta/Setup WITH intent**: Specific setup tied to payment purpose (‚ÄúLink your card to complete purchase‚Äù, ‚ÄúSet up autopay for rent‚Äù)

üö´ **Do NOT include** examples that are:
- Information-seeking only (‚ÄúHow does autopay work?‚Äù)
- Commerce-related without payment intent (‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the price?‚Äù)
- General non-payment conversation (‚ÄúHow was your day?‚Äù)

---

### üìå CONTEXT DETERMINATION
Context is **critical**:
- Words like ‚Äúpayment‚Äù or ‚Äúcard‚Äù alone are not enough.
- Only include texts that **clearly commit** to making or requesting a payment.

---

### üìù OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Generate **exactly {count} examples**.
- Each line = **one text example**.
- **No numbering or bullets** in the output.
- Ensure variety in:
- Tone
- Attribute tags
- Sentence length & complexity (short, long, simple, complex)
- Maximum text length is 400 words, the length should vary.
- Communication style (slang, abbreviations, formal text, bank bot notices, email-style, etc.)

---

### üîç QUALITY CONTROL
Before outputting, verify:
1. Does each example clearly express a **payment intent**?
2. Is there broad **tone and attribute variation**?
3. Are diverse contexts and relationships represented?
5. Does context unambiguously show **payment intent**?
